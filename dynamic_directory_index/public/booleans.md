In computer science, the **Boolean** (sometimes shortened to Bool) is a data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted *true* and *false*) which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra. 

It is named after George Boole, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid 19th century. 

The Boolean data type is primarily associated with conditional statements, which allow different actions by changing control flow depending on whether a programmer-specified Boolean *condition* evaluates to true or false.
